 Beepbox music portfolio made entirely from HTML and CSS styling.
 It features a widget for playing both my cover and the original song in Spotify.
(If you're logged in to Spotify you'll get the full song rather than just 30 seconds).

 BeepBox.co is an online tool for sketching and sharing instrumental music.
